To Run:

-put "bank-note" folder within SVM project on the same level as run.sh and other python scripts
-run the run.sh script to generate the outputs in the following order
    -svm-primal: will output to the primal-output.txt file
    -svm-dual: will output to the dual-output.txt file -----NOTE---- This can be slow so I am leaving a copy of its output in the SVM folder titled d-output.txt just in case you need it fast.
    -svm-kernel: will output to the kernel-output.txt file -----NOTE---- This can be slow so I am leaving a copy of its output in the SVM folder titled k-output.txt just in case you need it fast.

running that script will output all the required info for the questions in the homework
