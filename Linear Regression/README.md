To Run this code put the concrete folder into the Linear Regression folder then run the run.sh.
All the outputs for the various problems will be printed out in their associated output .txt files.
First the Batch gradient descent in batch output, then the stochiastic in sgd output. Then
the optimal weight vector will be put in analytical output.

Final cost info for batch and stochiastic are at the bottom of the output files.
