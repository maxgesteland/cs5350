To Run this code, just put the bank-note folder in the Perceptron folder on the same level as the python
scripts and run.sh. PLEASE SEE NOTE 2 for part of the answer to problem 2 b.

The run.sh will run all three different perceptron variations and report the outputs requested in the problems into their associated .txt files
-perceptron_output.txt for the standard perceptron
-voted_perceptron_output.txt for the voted perceptron
-average_perceptron_output.txt for the avg. perceptron

Note: average predictions for the voted is at the bottom of the txt file.

-IMPORTANT Note 2: I have left the vp_vectors_and_counts.txt in the project because it contains part of MY ANSWER for Problem 2 (b), which is the list of all weight vectors and their associated counts.

Note 3: if you wish to alter parameters you must change them in the call to the scripts in the run.sh
