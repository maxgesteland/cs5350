To Run this code, just put the bank-1 folder in the Ensemble learning folder on the same level as the python
scripts and run.sh. Then run the run.sh and the print outs for the different problems will print into
their associated output .txt files starting with adaboost, bagging and then random forest. I plotted all values
manually in google sheets.
