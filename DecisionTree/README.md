DecisionTree Instructions to run: 
-create "car" and "bank" folders in the DecisionTree folder,
or extract the zips and move the folders from the zips into the DecisionTree project
-each car and bank folder should have its respective test.csv and 
train.csv as the run.sh file uses paths of format "car/train.csv"
-Required Layout is: DecisionTree-bank
                                 -car
                                 -decisionTree.py
                                 -run.sh
-Outputs are printed for the car first on different metrics,
Then the bank on its different metrics/ top of bank is labeled "bank"
